      <p> <em>Steve Winwood was born on 12 May 1948 in Handsworth, Birmingham.</em> His father Lawrence, a
        foundryman by trade, was a semi-professional musician, playing mainly the saxophone and clarinet.
        Steve
        Winwood began playing piano at the age of four while interested in swing and Dixieland jazz, and
        soon
        started playing drums and guitar. He was also a choirboy at St.John's Church of England, Perry
        Barr.The
        family moved from Handsworth to Kingstanding (Atlantic Road) Birmingham, where Winwood attended the
        Great Barr School, one of the first comprehensive schools. He also attended the Birmingham and
        Midland Institute of Music to develop his skills as a pianist, but did not complete his course page
        needed During this time, he befriended future Fleetwood Mac member Christine McVie.better source
        needed.</p>
      <p> <strong>At eight years of age, Winwood first performed with his father and elder brother Muff in the
          RonAtkinson Band.</strong> Muff Winwood later recalled that when Steve began playing regularly
        with
        him and his father in licensed pubs and clubs, the piano had to be turned with its back to the
        audience
        to try to
        hide him because he was so obviously underage.</p>

      <h3>Solo Career</h3>

        <figcaption>Steve singing at Jazz festival</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> Weariness with the grind of touring and recording prompted Winwood to leave Traffic and retire to
        sessioning
        for some years.[better source needed] Under pressure from Island Records, he resurfaced with his
        self-titled first solo album in 1977. This was followed by his 1980 hit Arc of a Diver (which
        included
        his
        first solo hit, "While You See a Chance" ) and Talking Back to the Night in 1982.[citation needed]
        Both
        albums were recorded at his home in Gloucestershire with Winwood playing all instruments. He
        continued
        to do
        sessions during this period. In 1983, he co-produced and played on Jim Capaldi's top 40 hit "That's
        Love"</p>

      <p> 1986, Winwood
        travelled to New York City for his next album project. There, he enlisted the help of a coterie of
        stars
        to
        record Back in the High Life in the US, and the album was a hit. He topped the Billboard Hot 100
        with "Higher Love" and earned Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal
        Performance.
        He
        embarked on an extensive tour of North America in support of the album, and at the end of the tour,
        he
        divorced Nicole Weir in England then settled in the Nashville area with his new American wife,
        Eugenia
        Crafton.</p>

      <p> All these albums[clarification needed] were released by Island Records. However, at the peak of
        his commercial success, Winwood moved to Virgin Records and released Roll with It and Refugees of
        the
        Heart.[citation needed] The album Roll with It and the title track hit No. 1 on the US album and
        singles
        charts in the summer of 1988. Another album with Virgin, Far from Home, was officially credited to
        Traffic,
        but nearly all the instruments were played by Winwood.[citation needed] Despite lacking a
        significant
        hit,
        it broke the top 40 in both the UK and US.</p>
