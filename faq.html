                <dd>Steve Winwood was born on 12 May 1948 in Handsworth, Birmingham.</em> His father Lawrence, a
                    foundryman by trade, was a semi-professional musician, playing mainly the saxophone and clarinet.
                    Steve
                    Winwood began playing piano at the age of four while interested in swing and Dixieland jazz, and
                    soon
                    started playing drums and guitar.

                <dd> 1986, Winwood
                    travelled to New York City for his next album project. There, he enlisted the help of a coterie of
                    stars
                    to
                    record Back in the High Life in the US, and the album was a hit. He topped the Billboard Hot 100
                    with "Higher Love" and earned Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal
                    Performance.

                <dd> At eight years of age, Winwood first performed with his father and elder brother Muff in the
                    Ron Atkinson Band.</strong> Muff Winwood later recalled that when Steve began playing regularly with
                    him and his father in licensed pubs and clubs, the piano had to be turned with its back to the
                    audience
                    to try to
                    hide him because he was so obviously underage.
